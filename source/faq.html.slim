    | Help! I’m completely out of water! What can I do to get it back on?

      First thing you can do, before you call anyone, is to reset the breaker.
      Even if it doesn’t looked tripped, it can be disengaged enough to break
      the circuit. If you don’t know which breaker is it, you can simply reset
      them all (as well as your clocks).
  p

    |
      If the breaker isn’t at fault, you should call us so we can walk you
      through a couple other possibilities.  However, we do not encourage you to
      open electrical boxes on your own and tinker with the parts. The risk of
      electrocution is too great if you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with
      them.

  p.lead.question
    | I’m considering a filtration system, but I’m not sure I need it.
    | How can I be sure?
  p
    |
      There are four major facets of water quality that you should evaluate
      before buying a system from anyone: Color, Smell, Taste, and
      Contamination.
  p
    |
      To test for contamination, simply contact the health department for the
      county you live in and request a Bacteriological test (there will be a
      small fee). This test looks for the presence of bacteria, specifically
      coliform bacteria (it is sometimes called a coliform test). Wells that
      test positive should have a chlorination system installed to prevent
      illness. Other tests for lead and other chemicals are also available, for
      additional peace of mind.
  p
    |
      Testing for color, smell and taste is much easier. Simply pour your water
      in a large, clean and clear glass container and evaluate it using your
      senses. Place a sheet of blank computer paper behind the glass to evaluate
      the color, and use hot water when checking for odor (hot water amplifies
      odor). Look for sediment that falls to the bottom of the glass, and check
      your fixtures for scale or rust stains. Then if you still aren’t sure...

    | What kinds of tests are there to evaluate water, and can I
    | trust the results?
  p
    |
      Mosts tests and kits are extremely reliable and simple, especially if you
      are doing it yourself and can duplicate the results over two or three
      testings. However, there have been reports in the past of companies
      employing methods that are misleading, especially when a sale depends on
      it. Nowadays, there is little reason for a homeowner or business owner to
      rely on a salesman to do their water testing, because test kits are cheap
      and readily available on the internet. We use a very simple kit that
      evaluates PH, Hardness and Dissolved Iron in minutes. It is nearly
      identical to a test strip kit you would use to check a pool for PH and
      chlorine content.

  p.lead.question Do you give free estimates?
  p
    |
      The short answer is no, we do not. That is to say, we do not usually make
      appointments to come out to your place of residence or business to
      administer a quote, because we are usually able to provide one over the
      phone with great accuracy. However, in some cases it is prudent for us to
      get a lay of the land before establishing a firm quotation, and we will
      usually do so at no additional cost.
  p
    |
      We do provide consultations for a reduced service charge, by appointment.
      Usually, these consultations are purely educational, and are of great
      assistance to our clients in planning future projects, or simply
      understanding the care required for equipment they already have.

  p.lead.question Do you take credit cards?
  p
    |
      We will be able to take Visa, Mastercard, AmEx and Discover in the very
      near future, but we do not do so at this time. When we do, there will be a
      2.75% convenience fee per transaction. Until then, we gladly accept all
      checks, money orders and cash.

  p.lead.question Why is there a charge for travel on my invoice?
  p
    |
      Most companies that provide on the road services do charge separately for
      travel. Those that don’t charge for travel separately are making it up
      somewhere else in their pricing structure, usually with an inflated
      service charge or hourly rate. Our clients tend to side with us,
      preferring transparency in our billing. Plus, if your neighbor becomes a
      client on your route, we adjust your travel charge down in kind, resulting
      in a visible discount on every bill.
