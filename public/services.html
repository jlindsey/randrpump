piece of mind. We inspect every inch of each critical system, cleaning, lubricating, repairing or 
replacing small parts just before they naturally fail. In doing so, we can almost always prevent an 
inconvenient service interruption. In the cases where it happens anyway, members of our maintenance
 program enjoy a priority status and top-of-the-list response, as well as a discount on <u>all</u> labor charges. 
 Please inquire about this service if you are at all interested, as it is a product uniquely built around 
 your needs.</p><p>While you are still browsing, take time to review all of our services, because they are all included in 
our Full Service Preventative Maintenance program. 
</p><h3>Pump &amp; Motor Diagnostics and Repair</h3><p>We are competent and proficient with all makes and models, specializing in the hard-to-find, special order models.
When replacement is the only good option, we always recommend brands with excellent records for dependability and longevity.
For a full listing of our recommended brands, click <a href="#">here</a>.</p><h3>Periodic Irrigation System Maintenance</h3><p>Whether you want it as a stand-alone service, or part of a comprehensive maintenance service, the product is the same. 
We offer monthly, quarterly and annual schedules, or anything in between to help keep your system, lawn and landscaping 
in top condition. For a full listing of the brands we use, click <a href="#">here</a>.</p><h3>Water Filtration and Purification</h3><p>As development and construction keeps pace with growth, we pull water from places in the aquifer that we have never 
pulled from. Sometimes this means an intrusion of hardness, dissolved iron, colloidal iron, hydrogen sulfide 
(rotten-egg smell), tannic acid, and/or salt in your previously pristine water. Whatever the contaminant, we can
design a filtration system to remove it at a price that is much lower than the big name brands. We can also 
refurbish most existing systems to do the same job as a new system at a substantial savings!

through some basic steps over the phone that may restore service immediately. If that doesn’t work though, you 
can be assured that the next available tech is on their way, day or night, weekends and holidays. 
</p><h3>Full Service Installation and Repair</h3><p>Wherever you are, we come to you. We honor our commitment to the appointments we make, and do our best to be 
prompt, time-efficient and clean. If we must break an appointment (such as with a drinking water emergency), 
we try to be as sensitive to the value of your time as humanly possible by rescheduling immediately, 
and with minimal inconvenience to you.</p></div><div id="push"></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="container"><p class="credit">Copyright © 2013 <span class="mirror">R</span> &amp; R Pump Service. All rights reserved. Site design by Joshua Lindsey.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
