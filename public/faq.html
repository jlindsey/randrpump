I’m completely out of water! What can I do to get it back on?</p><p>First thing you can do, before you call anyone, is to reset the breaker. Even if it doesn’t looked tripped, 
it can be disengaged enough to break the circuit. If you don’t know which breaker is it, you can simply reset
them all (as well as your clocks).</p><p>If the breaker isn’t at fault, you should call us so we can walk you through a couple other possibilities. 
However, we do not encourage you to open electrical boxes on your own and tinker with the parts. The risk of 
electrocution is too great if you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with them.
</p><p class="lead question">I’m considering a filtration system, but I’m not sure I need it. How can I be sure?</p><p>There are four major facets of water quality that you should evaluate before buying a system from 
anyone: Color, Smell, Taste, and Contamination.</p><p>To test for contamination, simply contact the health department for the county you live in and request a 
Bacteriological test (there will be a small fee). This test looks for the presence of bacteria, specifically 
coliform bacteria (it is sometimes called a coliform test). Wells that test positive should have a chlorination 
system installed to prevent illness. Other tests for lead and other chemicals are also available, for additional 
peace of mind.</p><p>Testing for color, smell and taste is much easier. Simply pour your water in a large, clean and clear glass container 
and evaluate it using your senses. Place a sheet of blank computer paper behind the glass to evaluate the color, and 
use hot water when checking for odor (hot water amplifies odor). Look for sediment that falls to the bottom of the glass, 
and check your fixtures for scale or rust stains. Then if you still aren’t sure...
</p><p class="lead question">What kinds of tests are there to evaluate water, and can I trust the results?</p><p>Mosts tests and kits are extremely reliable and simple, especially if you are doing it yourself and can duplicate the 
results over two or three testings. However, there have been reports in the past of companies employing methods that 
are misleading, especially when a sale depends on it. Nowadays, there is little reason for a homeowner or business owner 
to rely on a salesman to do their water testing, because test kits are cheap and readily available on the internet. We 
use a very simple kit that evaluates PH, Hardness and Dissolved Iron in minutes. It is nearly identical to a test strip 
kit you would use to check a pool for PH and chlorine content. 
</p><p class="lead question">Do you give free estimates?</p><p>The short answer is no, we do not. That is to say, we do not usually make appointments to come out to your place of residence 
or business to administer a quote, because we are usually able to provide one over the phone with great accuracy. However, 
in some cases it is prudent for us to get a lay of the land before establishing a firm quotation, and we will usually do so 
at no additional cost.</p><p>We do provide consultations for a reduced service charge, by appointment. Usually, these consultations are purely educational,
and are of great assistance to our clients in planning future projects, or simply understanding the care required for equipment 
they already have.
</p><p class="lead question">Do you take credit cards?</p><p>We will be able to take Visa, Mastercard, AmEx and Discover in the very near future, but we do not do so at this time. When we do, 
there will be a 2.75% convenience fee per transaction. Until then, we gladly accept all checks, money orders and cash.
</p><p class="lead question">Why is there a charge for travel on my invoice?</p><p>Most companies that provide on the road services do charge separately for travel. Those that don’t charge for travel separately 
are making it up somewhere else in their pricing structure, usually with an inflated service charge or hourly rate. Our clients 
tend to side with us, preferring transparency in our billing. Plus, if your neighbor becomes a client on your route, we adjust 
your travel charge down in kind, resulting in a visible discount on every bill.
